# Kustomize GitOps Implementation Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Kustomize GitOps Implementation Guide for managing Kubernetes configurations! This tutorial is crafted to guide you through using Kustomize, a Kubernetes-native configuration management tool, to manage and deploy applications across different environments (development and production) without altering the base YAML files. Whether you're new to Kubernetes or looking to streamline your deployment process, this guide will introduce the principles of GitOps with Kustomize to achieve efficient, declarative configuration management.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- A working Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` installed and configured.
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes resource files and YAML syntax.


## Why Kustomize and its Features

### Why Kustomize?

Kustomize is a powerful tool for customizing Kubernetes resources without directly modifying the YAML files. It simplifies the management of configurations across different environments and promotes consistency in deployments. 

### Key Features of Kustomize:

- **Resource Templating:** Define reusable templates for Kubernetes resources and customize them for different environments.

- **Patch Management:** Apply patches to override or extend configurations defined in base resources.

- **Configuration Management:** Manage environment-specific configurations using overlays and configuration files.

- **Integration with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines:** Incorporate Kustomize into your CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment workflows.

## Installing Kustomize

### Mac:

You can install Kustomize on macOS using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install kustomize
```

### Windows:

For Windows users, you can download the Kustomize binary from the official GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to the [Kustomize releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases) on GitHub.
2. Download the appropriate binary for your Windows architecture (e.g., `kustomize_<version>_windows_amd64.zip`).
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
4. Add the directory containing the `kustomize` binary to your system's PATH environment variable.

After installation, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
kustomize version
```

This command should display the installed version of Kustomize.


## Understanding the Directory Structure

The structure divides base configurations and overlays for easy customization across environments:

```
.
├── base
│   ├── config.properties
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
└── overlays
    ├── dev
    │   ├── config.properties
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── replicas.yaml
    └── prod
        ├── config.properties
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── replicas.yaml
```

## Base Configuration

### `deployment.yaml` & `service.yaml`

Define your Kubernetes Deployment and Service.

### `kustomization.yaml`

```yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
- service.yaml
configMapGenerator:
- name: app-config
  files:
  - config.properties
```

Includes base resources and generates a ConfigMap from `config.properties`, providing a foundation for customization.

## Customizing for Development Environment

### `dev/config.properties`

Overrides base configuration with development-specific settings.

### `dev/replicas.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 2
```

Adjusts the replica count for development needs.

### `dev/kustomization.yaml`

```yaml
bases:
- ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
- replicas.yaml
configMapGenerator:
- name: app-config
  behavior: merge
  files:
  - config.properties
```

Applies development overlays, modifying replicas and merging configuration properties.

## Customizing for Production Environment

Production customization follows a similar pattern but focuses on production readiness, such as higher replica counts and production-specific configuration values.

## Applying Configurations

Deploy to development:

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev/
```

Deploy to production:

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/prod/
```

These commands apply environment-specific customizations, showcasing Kustomize's ability to manage deployments efficiently.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on mastering Kustomize for GitOps in Kubernetes! You've learned how to manage complex configurations across multiple environments without redundancy, ensuring consistent, traceable, and efficient deployments. Continue to explore Kustomize's capabilities to further refine and enhance your deployment strategies.
